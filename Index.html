     <h1>Facilities We Offer</h1>
     <p>Many people dont think twice about these facilities unless they need them. But healthcare is a hot career destination for many, and its good to know more about the facilities you may end up working in if you choose to pursue a healthcare career.<br> So lets take a closer look at some of the most common settings you may work in as a healthcare professional.</p>
     <div class="row">
         
         <div class="facilities-col">
            <h3> Birth centers</h3>
            <p>Birth centers are not typically equipped with the same contingency equipment and staff as a hospital, such as surgeons in case of a C-section or a neonatal intensive care unit. As a result, birth centers accommodate only healthy pregnancies without any known risk or complication factors.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="facilities-col">
            <h3>Blood banks</h3>
            <p>Blood banks allow donors to donate blood and platelets while also storing and sorting blood into components that can be used most effectively by patients.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="facilities-col">
            <h3>Urgent care</h3>
            <p>Urgent care (UR) facilities exist for on-demand healthcare needs that arent severe enough for the emergency room, but are too severe or concerning to wait for a scheduled appointment at the doctor’s office. Urgent care is a common choice when children get sick, for example, and need an immediate diagnosis or relief from symptoms.</p>

                 We met Dr Vijay Chennamchetty last month with severe cough and sputum for my father Dr Varaprasad. His way of handling patients is excellent and so soothing that the patient feels immensely confident about recovery. Thanks to Dr. Vijay, within 2 weeks, he is completely normal.
